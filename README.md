Source code to find critical points in string theory 
In the code, the user can choose among several contributions to the scalar potential assuming the complex structure is already stabilized. 
The algorithm employs a hybrid algorithm, namely, Simulated annealing + Conjugate gradients and a specific error function to look for stable vacua. 
In the last part of the source code, the user can visualize the results.
